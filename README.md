# Java Coffee Management System

The **Java Coffee Management System** is a Spring Boot-based microservices application designed to manage coffee shop operations. It consists of three core services: **Main API**, **Email Service**, and **SMS Service**. The Main API handles core business logic (e.g., user authentication, order management), while the Email and SMS Services manage notifications via Spring Mail and AWS SNS, respectively. RabbitMQ enables asynchronous communication between services, and PostgreSQL is used for data persistence. This project leverages GitHub Projects for task tracking, making development more engaging and rewardingâ€”every closed issue feels like a victory!

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- **Java**: 17 or higher
- **Maven**: 3.8.0 or higher
- **PostgreSQL**: 15 or higher
- **RabbitMQ**: 3.10 or higher
- **AWS Account**: For SNS (SMS Service)
- **Docker**: For containerized deployment (optional)
- **Git**: For cloning the repository

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/java-coffee-management-system.git
   cd java-coffee-management-system
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   - Copy the `application-prod.yml.example` files for each service (Main API, Email Service, SMS Service) to `application-prod.yml`.
   - Add sensitive configuration details (e.g., `DB_PASSWORD`, `JWT_SECRET`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SECRET_KEY`) in a `.env` file or as environment variables.
   - Example `.env`:
     ```bash
     DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
     JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
     AWS_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_access_key
     AWS_SECRET_KEY=your_aws_secret_key
     SPRING_MAIL_PASSWORD=your_email_password
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

4. **Set Up PostgreSQL**:
   - Create a database named `coffee_shop`.
   - Update `application-dev.yml` and `application-prod.yml` with your database credentials.

5. **Set Up RabbitMQ**:
   - Install and run RabbitMQ locally or use a cloud instance.
   - Configure connection details in `application-dev.yml` and `application-prod.yml`.

6. **Run the Application**:
   - Start each service in development mode:
     ```bash
     mvn spring-boot:run -pl main-api -Dspring.profiles.active=dev
     mvn spring-boot:run -pl email-service -Dspring.profiles.active=dev
     mvn spring-boot:run -pl sms-service -Dspring.profiles.active=dev
     ```
   - Alternatively, use Docker for production:
     ```bash
     docker-compose up --build
     ```

7. **Test the Application**:
   - Use Postman or `curl` to test endpoints (e.g., `/api/auth/login`, `/api/orders`).
   - Example `curl` for login:
     ```bash
     curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username":"user","password":"pass"}'
     ```

## Configuration

The project uses environment-specific configuration files located in `src/main/resources`:

- `application-dev.yml`: Development environment settings.
- `application-prod.yml`: Production environment settings (use `.env` or environment variables for sensitive data).
- `application-test.yml`: Testing environment with H2 database.

Key configurations include:

- **JWT**: Configured via `JwtProperties.java` (e.g., `jwt.secret`, `jwt.expiration`).
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for dev/prod, H2 for tests.
- **RabbitMQ**: Queues (`emailQueue`, `smsQueue`) configured in `RabbitMQConfig.java`.
- **Spring Mail**: Email settings for Email Service.
- **AWS SNS**: SNS settings for SMS Service.

Example `application-prod.yml.example`:
```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:postgresql://${DB_HOST:localhost}:5432/coffee_shop
    username: ${DB_USERNAME}
    password: ${DB_PASSWORD}
  mail:
    host: smtp.example.com
    port: 587
    username: ${MAIL_USERNAME}
    password: ${MAIL_PASSWORD}
  rabbitmq:
    host: ${RABBITMQ_HOST:localhost}
    port: 5672
    username: ${RABBITMQ_USERNAME}
    password: ${RABBITMQ_PASSWORD}
aws:
  sns:
    access-key: ${AWS_ACCESS_KEY}
    secret-key: ${AWS_SECRET_KEY}
    region: us-east-1
jwt:
  secret: ${JWT_SECRET}
  expiration: 86400000
```

**Note**: Ensure `.gitignore` excludes `application-prod.yml` and `.env` to prevent committing sensitive data.
